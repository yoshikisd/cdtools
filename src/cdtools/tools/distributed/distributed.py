"""Contains functions to make reconstruction scripts compatible
with multi-GPU distributive approaches in PyTorch.

The functions in this module require parts of the user-written
reconstruction script to be first wrapped in a function (as shown in 
examples/fancy_ptycho_multi_gpu_ddp.py). The functions in this module
are designed to wrap around/call these user-defined functions, enabling
reconstructions to be performed across several GPUs.

As of 20250302, the methods here are based on 
torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel, which implements distributed
data parallelism. In this scheme, replicas of the CDI/ptychography model
are given to each device. These devices will synchronize gradients across
each model replica. These methods however do not define how the Dataset is
distributed across each device; this process can be handled by using
DistributedSampler with the DataLoader.
